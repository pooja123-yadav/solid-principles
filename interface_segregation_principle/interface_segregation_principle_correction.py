"""
This implementation violates the ISP because it forces OldPrinter to expose an interface that the class 
doesnâ€™t implement or need. To fix this issue, you should separate the interfaces into smaller and more 
specific classes. Then you can create concrete classes by inheriting from multiple interface classes as 
needed:
