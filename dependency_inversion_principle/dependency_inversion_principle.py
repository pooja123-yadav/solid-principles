"""
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules must not depend on low-level modules. 
Instead, both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes decoupling, meaning concrete classes
are loosely coupled with high-level classes. To achieve this, classes should depend on interfaces or abstract classes,
not on concrete classes or functions
